# Program Calculation Problems

This project consists of several isolated complex problems to be solved through meticulous programming based on the calculation of programs.
The solution was written in **Haskell**, in combination with **lhs2tex**, making it a literate program where the code and documentation blend together in a natural way.

It was developed in **Program Calculation**, in the second semester of the 2nd year of the Bachelor's degree (2018/19).
